# RF_adjust
Voice output in Jeti transmitter of Rotorflight Governor status and Rotorflight adjustments  

      
Copy the file "RF_adjust.lua" and the folder "Rotorflight" in the "/Apps/" folder of the transmitter   

If you are using a different language than Englisch or German, you have to create new folders in the "/Rotorflight" Directory with the corresponding ending like "_cz", "_fr", "_pt".
There you put your files, but make sure the filename is the same than the englisch ones.
