# RF_adjust
Voice output in Jeti transmitter of Rotorflight Governor state and Rotorflight adjustments  

# Installation:      
Copy the file "RF_adjust.lua" and the folder "Rotorflight" in the "/Apps/" folder of the transmitter   

If you are using a different language than Englisch or German, you have to create new folders in the "/Rotorflight" Directory with the corresponding ending like "_cz", "_fr", "_pt".
There you put your files, but make sure the filename is the same than the englisch ones.  
If you are just using one language you will need just the "adjfunc_" and the "governor_" folder, if you are using more languages you have to copy all folders which you are using.
